# Reinforcement-Learning-Pong-Game

The code devices a RL model using neural networks, rewards discount, and policy gradient concepts, and the pong model is able to score 2 or 3 against 20 after being trained for 750 episodes. Google colab was used to create, train, and test the model.
Video file 'rl-video-episode-0.mp4' shows the agent playing the game.
